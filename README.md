Hi, I am @happyharryh. Very glad to be in this great open source world.üéâ

My contribution in Github began with [Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt), which is really an awesome software for me and my wife.üëè Before all, I would like to introduce our gaming environment.

Thanks to Moonlight, we can play games in the living room using a 65 inch TV, in the bed room using a 100 inch screen, or even far away from home using a laptop (thanks to [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/) which provides the virtual LAN). As for the devices which Moonlight is working on, I used to be banking on the embedded Android system of the TV and the projector. They did work, but the decoding latency was up to 20 ~ 50 ms, which affected the game experience significantly. I found that the decoding latency of Intel x86 CPU based devices is much lower (< 1 ms).üëç So, I use an Intel NUC in the living room and an old Intel laptop in the bed room now. They decode the video and send it to TV/projector by HDMI.

We really enjoy playing games using Moonlight. And thanks to [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) 2.24.0 released in August 2022, the support for Nintendo controllers, especially the Joy-Cons, was improved. It brings us much more enjoyment when playing games remotely, as I love playing Nintendo Switch games in Yuzu. While playing, I found there are still some problems affecting the game experience, which lead to my contribution in Github.

- There are two modes of a single Joy-Con: the horizontal (mini-gamepad) mode for games like Mario Kart, and the vertical (one-handed) model for games like Just Dance. SDL only supported the horizontal mode, but not the vertical mode. So, I sent this [pull request](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/6303) for the supporting.
- When playing Just Dance, the most important thing is the motion sensing. However, due to the limitation of NVIDIA Stream, the sensor data was not sent to the game PC. I used [BetterJoy](https://github.com/Davidobot/BetterJoy) and [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows) to send sensor data to the game PC by [CemuHook Protocal](https://github.com/v1993/cemuhook-protocol). They are both wonderful softwares, and I have developed a feature of [customizing the stick calibration](https://github.com/happyharryh/BetterJoy/tree/calibration-for-sticks) for BetterJoy.
- Although there are BetterJoy and DS4Windows, I still wanted to integrate the motion sensor supporting into Moonlight. So, I developed an embedded [CemuHook Server](https://github.com/happyharryh/moonlight-qt/tree/cemuhook-server) for Moonlight.
- While developing, I found that the order of the Controller Sensor Event of SDL was a little bit troubled. So, I sent this [pull request](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/6373) to make it smooth.
- In addition, I found that the sensor might be 30% more sensitive in some axises. It was a bug introduced by SDL 2.24.0 (this [commit](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/d7c07d6b09de6f9ae3c7bb3eb1765c7a10af4b3b)). I fixed it in this [pull request](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/6394).
- For convenience, I developed a [Joy-Cons combine mode toggle](https://github.com/happyharryh/moonlight-qt/tree/joy-con-combine-mode) for Moonlight. I will developed the Joy-Cons vertical mode toggle in the future, after the feature of the vertical model is merged into the release version of SDL.
- I also developed a feature for the [stick calibration](https://github.com/happyharryh/moonlight-qt/tree/stick-calibration) of game controllers in Moonlight.
- When playing Rumbleverse, my wife wanted to use the voice chat built in the game. However, due to the limitation of NVIDIA Stream, the voice data was not sent to the game PC. I developed an embedded [VBan Emitter](https://github.com/happyharryh/moonlight-qt/tree/vban-emitter) for Moonlight to support the voice data sending by [VBAN Protocal](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/vban.htm).
- The features of CemuHook Server and VBan Emitter are useful for us, but not really a good fit for the mainline version of Moonlight. They may be better built as plug-ins for those who need them. I opened this [Issue](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/issues/883) for Moonlight, requesting the interface of plug-ins.
- Sometimes, my ZeroTier may be with high latency for some reasons. In this situation, my Moonlight might crash randomly. I found it was caused by out-of-sequence audio packets in the low quality network, which was an imperceptible bug of [moonlight-common-c](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c). I fixed it in this [pull request](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c/pull/72) by adding only one line of codes.

Welcome to leave me messages if you have any idea. Although my English is not idiomatic, I hope you can easily get my points~üòù
